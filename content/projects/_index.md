### Projects
**Alchemy Lab (WIP)** | [repo](https://github.com/j9smith/alchemy-lab)<br>
*An evolving research infrastructure for diffusion models. Built around modular components, it supports architecture composition and experiment setup with associated training/deployment infrastructure.*

**Manipulation Lab** | [repo](https://github.com/j9smith/manipulation-lab)<br>
*A modular research and benchmarking framework for robotic manipulation built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, designed to facilitate rapid experimentation and support the evaluation of emerging generalist robot learning models. It enables reproducible, configuration-driven experiments across diverse tasks, sensors, and embodiments, reducing ecosystem fragmentation and lowering switching costs through a flexible, low/no-code design.*

**Fin-LLM** | [repo](https://github.com/j9smith/fin-llm)<br>
*Addressing financial inequality by reducing informational and cognitive barriers faced by non-expert financial market participants. It consolidates fragmented market-relevant data and delivers tailored, accessible insights, helping to bridge the gap between professional-grade financial knowledge and the general public.*
