Data Science & Artificial Intelligence MSc graduate with a love for the field and a hands-on approach to learning. I enjoy building things and sharing what I learn along the way. I'm looking to grow into a machine learning engineering role where I can apply what I've learned to real-world problems. I bring a strong foundation in ML fundamentals, practical software experience, and an eagerness to collaborate with curious, like-minded people. Currently exploring generative modelling.

### Education
**University of Liverpool**<br>
*Data Science & Artificial Intelligence MSc, Distinction* | 2024-2025

**University of Chester**<br>
*Economics BSc, First Class* | 2020-2023

### Projects
**Manipulation Lab** | [repo](https://github.com/j9smith/manipulation-lab)<br>
*A modular benchmarking framework for robotic manipulation built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, designed to support the evaluation of emerging generalist robot learning models. It enables reproducible, configuration-driven experiments across diverse tasks, sensors, and embodiments, reducing ecosystem fragmentation and lowering switching costs through a flexible, low/no-code design.*

**Fin-LLM** | [repo](https://github.com/j9smith/fin-llm)<br>
*Addressing financial inequality by reducing informational and cognitive barriers faced by non-expert financial market participants. It consolidates fragmented market-relevant data and delivers tailored, accessible insights, helping to bridge the gap between professional-grade financial knowledge and the general public.*
